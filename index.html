    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the application <strong>“Silver Japanese: Vocabulary”</strong> (the “app”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the app. By using the app you agree to the terms described here.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Information stored locally on your device</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Language preferences</strong> (UI language, display options) — stored on your device so the app remembers your choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice progress and session data</strong> — stored locally so you can resume studying where you left off.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information shared with third parties</h3>
    <p>When ads are displayed the app works with advertising partners. Those partners may collect or receive:</p>
    <ul>

    <h3>EU/EEA/UK users — UMP SDK</h3>
    <p>For users in the EU/EEA and the UK, the app uses Google’s <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> SDK to present a consent form and record your choice for ad personalization.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The consent form lets you accept ads.</li>
      <li>Your choice is respected and applied to ad requests.</li>
      <li>Ads are personalized by default, but if those are not possible due to an error, the app will display non-personalized ads.</li>
      <li>If you explicitly decline ad storage/consent required by some ad providers, any kind of ads will not show at all.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note" role="note">
